        Testudo Bank Frontend Redesign and Reimplementation
      </h1>
      <p><em>Owners: Jason Cavanaugh</em></p>
      <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Customers of Testudo Bank expect a clean and enjoyable user experience.
        The current implementation of Testudo Bank does not provide that. While
        the basic functionality is there, the user interface leaves much to be
        desired. We want customers of Testudo Bank to feel like they are using
        the banking software of the future, not the banking software of the
        early 2000s. If we are going to support such forward-looking ventures
        such as cryptocurrency, let our software also at least look the part.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal is for an overhaul of the Testudo Bank frontend. The
        current frontend is implemented with <code>.jsp</code>. I propose that
        we redesign the frontend to use a modern UI framework. This will allow
        for cleaner, more maintainable frontend code and will thus contribute to
        the longevity of Testudo Bank.
      </p>
      <h2 id="solution-requirements">Solution Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The frontend of the application should use a modern UI framework (such
          as React, Angular, Svelte, or Vue)
        </li>
        <li>
          The various pages of the application should be redesigned to be more
          visually appealing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our new frontend code should strive to keep the state management of
          the frontend simple and straightforward. This will allow other
          engineers to onboard into our codebase more quickly and allow for
          changes to be made more quickly to our code.
        </li>
        <li>
          We should pick a framework that is well-established and has been used
          in other enterprise software.
        </li>
        <li>
          We should pick a framework that will allow us to hire developers more
          easily. For example, choosing React would mean that we have the
          largest pool of frontend developers to hire from, since React is so
          widely used. In contrast, choosing something like
          <a href="https://yew.rs/" target="_blank">Yew</a>, while perhaps
          bringing performance benefits, would not be easy to hire for and would
          not be as battle-tested.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed solution would be to use some kind of modern frontend
        framework to reimplement the frontend of the application. Here are a few
        potential options.
      </p>
      <h3>React</h3>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Our current team of developers is already familiar</li>
        <li>Many developers to hire from</li>
        <li>Widely used throughout the industry and in enterprise software</li>
        <li>
          Many, many, many libraries and packages to help us with whatever we
          need to build
        </li>
        <li>
          By far the most documentation and resources out of all the frameworks
          due to its popularity
        </li>
        <li>Fairly easy to pick up</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Less opinionated than other frameworks. It might be difficult to
          figure out what set of technologies is best suited to our particular
          use-case
        </li>
        <li>Less performant than other options</li>
        <li>
          Easier to build out bad patterns due to the fact that it is a library
          and not a framework
        </li>
        <li>Many bad React developers out there since it is so widely used</li>
        <li>useEffect can be difficult</li>
        <li>Will have to install many other packages</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Angular</h3>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More opinionated than React, meaning that it will try to steer us
          towards good design patterns
        </li>
        <li>
          Comes with many useful tools by default (e.g. TypeScript, a router,
          etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Also used widely in enterprise software</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>More difficult to hire for than React</li>
        <li>Steep learning curve</li>
        <li>Fewer options about how to build due to its opinionated nature</li>
        <li>Many developers dislike it</li>
        <li>Our developers are unfamiliar with it</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Svelte</h3>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The simplest option out of the three</li>
        <li>Developers love it</li>
        <li>Least amount of boilerplate</li>
        <li>Tiny bundle sizes</li>
        <li>Our developers are eager to use it on a project</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not nearly as widely used as Angular and React, so it will be harder
          to hire for
        </li>
        <li>Not used in enterprise nearly as much as Angular and React</li>
        <li>
          Not as much OSS software built for it. Fewer libraries and packages to
          choose from
        </li>
        <li>Smaller community</li>
        <li>Our developers are unfamiliar with it</li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        The db schema would not change for this particular feature
        implementation because this is a purely frontend feature.
